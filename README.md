# OMSCS6601_Transcripts

In the effort of note taking for the OMSCS course 6601, Artificial Intelligence, I often find out that I need to refer to the subtitles of the videos. The subtitiles, however, were broke down for key screens and contain a lot of timing information which are hard to read. Thus, I took some time to convert all the subtittles into human readable texts before I took notes for the courese. And I am sharing them with anyone who is interested in them.

My notes are published [here](https://www.jianshu.com/p/a3c89cc25b1b).
